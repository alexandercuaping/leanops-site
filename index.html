          LeanOps is a lightweight MES-style toolkit that gives supervisors, operators, and owners
          a single real-time view of jobs, stations, and performance — without a giant IT project.

          <h3>1. Supervisor console</h3>
          <p>
            A browser-based control panel where supervisors load jobs, assign workcenters,
            and see real-time status for each station.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>2. Floor displays & tablets</h3>
          <p>
            Simple TV dashboards and operator tablets that show the next job, current queue,
            and status — no logins or complex menus.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>3. Cloud data & KPIs</h3>
          <p>
            A lean data layer that tracks job completion, on-time performance, and output by
            station — ready for daily review and long-term improvement.

      <h2>Why manufacturers use LeanOps</h2>
      <div class="lo-grid lo-grid-2">
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>Built from the floor up</h3>
          <p>
            LeanOps is designed by someone who actually runs production — not just consultants.
            Every screen is focused on helping real supervisors and operators do their jobs faster.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>Start small, scale when ready</h3>
          <p>
            Begin with one department or workcenter. Once it’s working, expand to additional
            lines, processes, or sites without changing how people work.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>No giant IT project</h3>
          <p>
            LeanOps is intentionally lightweight: browser-based, simple to host, and designed
            to integrate with your existing spreadsheets and ERP later if needed.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>Measurable, daily impact</h3>
          <p>
            Track on-time vs late jobs, throughput, and station utilization so leadership can
            see real improvements week over week.
