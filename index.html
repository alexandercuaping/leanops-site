    <!-- FOUNDER STORY -->

      <h2>Built by someone who runs a production floor</h2>
      <div class="lo-grid lo-grid-1">
        <article class="lo-card lo-card-soft">
          <p>
            LeanOps was created by a manufacturing engineer and production supervisor who was tired
            of relying on whiteboards, tribal knowledge, and scattered spreadsheets to keep
            production moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of a bloated six-figure MES, LeanOps focuses on lightweight dashboards designed
            to deliver clarity, speed, and accountability without disrupting how people already work.

        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>Built from the floor up</h3>
          <p>
            LeanOps is designed by someone who actually runs production — not just consultants.
            Every screen is focused on helping real supervisors and operators do their jobs faster.

          <h3>Start small, scale when ready</h3>
          <p>
            Begin with one department or workcenter. Once it’s working, expand to additional
            lines, processes, or sites without changing how people work.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card">
          <h3>No giant IT project</h3>
          <p>
            LeanOps is intentionally lightweight: browser-based, simple to host, and designed
            to integrate with your existing spreadsheets and ERP later if needed.
