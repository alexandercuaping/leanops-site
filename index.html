      <h2>Why LeanOps exists</h2>
      <div class="lo-grid lo-grid-1">
        <article class="lo-card lo-card-soft">
          <p>
            Most MES and OEE systems are built for machine-heavy, fully automated plants with big IT teams.
            But many factories don’t need machine connectivity or a giant platform — they just need
            a clear, real-time picture of what’s running, what’s next, and where flow is stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            LeanOps focuses on the essentials of running a production department: jobs, stations, materials,
            and pacing. It’s the digital version of how strong supervisors already run the floor — just more
            visible, more consistent, and easier to manage every day.

        <article class="lo-card lo-card-soft">
          <p>
            LeanOps was created by a manufacturing engineer and production supervisor who was tired
            of relying on whiteboards, tribal knowledge, and scattered spreadsheets to keep
            production moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of a bloated six-figure MES, LeanOps focuses on lightweight dashboards designed
            to deliver clarity, speed, and accountability without disrupting how people already work.

    <!-- COMPETITOR POSITIONING -->

      <h2>How LeanOps compares</h2>
      <div class="lo-grid lo-grid-2">
        <article class="lo-card lo-card-soft">
          <h3>vs. heavy MES platforms</h3>
          <p>
            Many MES tools (and no-code platforms) are built for large, automated plants. They require
            long implementations, developers, and big budgets — and ship with hundreds of features your
            team will never use.
          </p>
          <p>
            LeanOps is intentionally lightweight: deploy a pilot in a single department, get value in
            days, and expand only when it earns its place on the floor.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="lo-card lo-card-soft">
          <h3>vs. machine-focused OEE systems</h3>
          <p>
            OEE tools focus on machine uptime and spindle utilization. LeanOps focuses on something
            different: people, jobs, and flow. It’s ideal for manual or semi-manual assembly, mixed-model
            operations, and departments where the constraint is coordination, not machine runtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real alternative to LeanOps isn’t another app — it’s whiteboards, spreadsheets, and
            supervisors chasing updates all day.
